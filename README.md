# javinla -- A command line tool to easily Java installation

## DESCRIPTION

Javinla makes very easy an Java installation on your server. You don't need to
set ppa repositories (ubuntu/debian) or use aur packages (archlinux) and get
latest java version. Just select the Java version you want to install and
that's all.

### Why?

The main goal is space-saving if you build docker images with Java. When I used
PPA java repositories my docker images became over 600 MB with unnecessary data
like fonts, x11 libs etc. Java Server JRE 7 is "only" 154 MB and I want keep my
docker images as small as possible.
